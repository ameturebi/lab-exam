## DSA Lab Exam 
- This repository consists of solutions to several DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) problems implemented in Python. Below is a brief overview of each problem and its solution:

# 1. Number Search Program
- Problem Description
- Write a program that allows the user to enter a sequence of numbers into an array. The program should then prompt the user to enter a number to be searched. The program - - should determine if the number is present in the array and, if so, display the number of times it appears.

- Solution
- The solution prompts the user to input a sequence of numbers, stores them in an array, and then prompts for a number to be searched. It then searches the array and counts - the occurrences of the input number.

# 2. Stack Implementation
- Problem Description
- Implement a stack using arrays in your preferred programming language, including push and pop operations.

-  Solution
- The solution provides a code snippet demonstrating the implementation of a stack using arrays. It includes push and pop operations.

# 3. Linear Queue Using Two Stacks
- Problem Description
- Implement a linear queue data structure using two stacks in Java, where the stacks are implemented using arrays. The implementation should provide functionality for enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations, adhering to the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.

- Solution
- The solution presents a Java implementation of a linear queue using two stacks. It includes enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations following the FIFO principle.

# 4. Bubble Sort
- Problem Description
- Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of alphabets (ASCII).

- Solution
- The solution provides an implementation of the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of alphabets based on ASCII values.

# 5. Merge Sort
- Problem Description
- Use mergesort to sort the numbers entered in question 1.

- Solution
- The solution applies the mergesort algorithm to sort the numbers entered in question 1, ensuring efficient and stable sorting.
